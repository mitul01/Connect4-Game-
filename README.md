# About the Game 

Connect Four is the commercial trademark name of a classic four in a row game. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy for children to learn, and the trillions of possible winning combinations present unique challenges for adults.

# CONNECT FOUR RULES
The game rules for Connect Four are just as simple as the directions for play. Since only one checker can be placed in the board at a time and all of the slots are divided into rows and columns, it’s not possible to cheat and move a checker once it has been placed. Checkers in the board may not be manipulated. Each player may drop only one checker into the grid per turn.


A winner is declared when one player gets four of their colored checkers in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Other configurations, such as squares, don’t count as winning combinations.
